# EulerBricks
A simple python script to generate primitive Euler Bricks

[What is an Euler Brick?](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerBrick.html)

## Purpose:
Aside from simply enjoying math and the idea of Euler Bricks, I want to be able to take a simple algorithm and increase its efficiency, learning new techniques in the process.

## Things to do:
1. Number-theoretical constraints
2. Addition of new bricks to a SQL database
3. Useful entry viewing and sorting (PHP?)
