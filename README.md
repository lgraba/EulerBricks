# EulerBricks
A simple python script to generate primitive Euler Bricks

[What is an Euler Brick?](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerBrick.html)

## Purpose:
Aside from simply enjoying math and the idea of Euler Bricks, I want to be able to take a simple algorithm and increase its efficiency, learning new techniques in the process.

## Things to do:
1. Number-theoretical constraints
  1. See convex hull (Newton polygon) constraint on coordinate plane of polynomial of two variables
  	+ (A Strategy of Numeric Search For Perfect Cuboids in the Case of the Second Cuboid Conjecture)[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.07161v1.pdf] Masharov, Sharipov
2. Addition of new bricks to a SQL database
3. Useful entry viewing and sorting (PHP?)
